				<h1>Hi, let me introduce my self</h1>
                <h2>Hello World</h2>
				<p>The words "hello world" are the foundation of every programming language. For every student of code, the first print made is hello world.</p> 
                    <p>Our planet is heading in the direction of artificial intelligence technology, computers, and electronics, which has always been my passion.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since moving to the United Kingdom at the end of 2018, I've decided to devote the rest of my life to do something I enjoy and will remain on Earth in perpetuity for the sole purpose of assisting humans being .</p>
                    
                    <p>You will be surprise to learn that everything is based on code and programming in all sectors of life, from the music recording software to music application.</p>
                    
                    <p>Well I just mentioned music first because music is one of my favorite hobbies, but coding is not only on music coding can be found in every thing you can imagine from the banking system, the world of digital games , the machines in hospitals, the photographers who work with images software, the TV shows, the ecosystem who is studied by machines programmed to act the way the developer decides. </p>
                    
                    <p> Software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on adevice and machines to execute specific tasks. </p>
                    
                    <p>We have noticed since 2019 with Covid pandemic how our world was forced to change to the digital world, food ordered by the simple click on your smartphone, bills paid by a simple transaction in your laptop or in your Tablet, iPad or mobile phone. </p>

                    <p>Millions of individuals lost their jobs in factories, The cyber warfare of nations worries our leaders because everything is globalized and centered on artificial intelligence.</p>
                    
                    <p>Governments invest everything they can to train young developers like me to insure themselves against possible attacks that can be fatal.</p>

                    <p>Even our electricity is based on programming and cutting the electricity we have no light or energy and without light we can't do anything, all bank system will fail, not to buy not to sell not to work not to study we will not be able to warm up and the food in the fridge would spoil. So without wanting to say too much or to tire the reader I am Mauro Melo and today I can confidently say that I chose the right profession.</p>
                        
                        <p>For me, programming is where I found myself, a world of infinite possibilities where I can create and develop my ability to create in an infinite way.</p>

                        <p>I would like to thank's for the opportunity to study here in England, thanks to all the teachers and masters because without them we could not reach the final goal which is to become a software and programming engineer.</p>
