				<h1>Hi , I am a software developer</h1>
				<p>Coding has been a passion of mine for several years.</p> 
                    <p>I took my first official coding course with a very prestige online school code nation in the UK.</p>
                    
                    <p>I have been experimenting with developing websites through the use HTML5 and CSS.</p>
                    
                    <p>I dedicate my time to gain more knowledge and experience in to web development and working on my coding skills.</p>
                    
                    <p>During my time with code nation, i have had the opportunity to develop a game using Python with my team. </p>
                    <p>Here I was able to enhance my communication and interpersonal skills that i already possess. </p>
                    <p>Working within a team also meant that i was able to show my leadership and listening skills. </p>
                    <p>Whilst working on this game project i was able to demonstrate my true nature of being a team player.</p>
                    
                    <p>In my spare time I enjoy reading, making music and spending time with my family. 
                    One of my favourite hobbies is creative writing including poems and storys.</p>
					<p>My goal in the future is to become a professional software engineer and work alongside large companies 
                        aswell as run my own programs. 
                        I aspire to be the best that i can be in those field.</p>
